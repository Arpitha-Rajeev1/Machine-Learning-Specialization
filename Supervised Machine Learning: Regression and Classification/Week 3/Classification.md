In Classfication, especially when output values can take only 2 two values like true or false (categories or classes) called as Binary Classification. If for the question, the answer is yes, then we can call it belongs to a positive class and the opposite is called negative class. If we try to predict this using Linear Regression whose output can take more values than just 2, then we set a threshold. If the threshold is 0.5, then if the predicted value f_wb(x) is less than the threshold, we can
classify it as a positive class anything above that as negative class. But as we add a new training example, the model doesn't predict properly.
