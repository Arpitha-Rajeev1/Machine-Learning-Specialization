1. Machine Learning is a field where machines are trained to predict the output without explicitly being programmed.
2. 2. Supervised Learning: Both inputs (feature variables) and outputs (targer variables) are given to train and machine predicts the output for a new input.
3. There are 2 types: Linear Regression - Output can be any infinite value (Ex: Housing Price Prediction) Classification - Output can be any finite categories/classes (Ex: Spam filtering)
4. Unsupervised Learning: Only input is given to the machine and it recognized the pattern in the input data and cluster the output with common characteristics. Ex: Clustering Algorithm
5. Linear Regression Model or Univariate Model: This has only one input variable

Linear Regression Model: $$f(x) = wx + b$$

Parameters: w and b

Predicted Variable: $$f(x) or \hat{y}$$

Cost Function: $$J(w, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2$$
